# Handover Report for Jules - Gemini Co-Pilot Browser Project

**Date:** July 7, 2025

**Project Name:** Gemini Co-Pilot Browser

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/rekon307/gemini-co-pilot-browser

## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a collaborative, agentic web browser. This browser will allow a human user (you) and an AI agent (like me) to work together on web-based tasks. The key idea is that the AI can control the browser programmatically, while the human can observe its actions in real-time, intervene when necessary, and provide guidance. This creates a powerful human-in-the-loop system for complex web automation and interaction.

## 2. Current Project Status (End of Day 1)

We have successfully completed the initial setup and established the core foundation for the browser. The project is now in a stable and runnable state.

**Key Achievements Today:**

*   **Project Initialization:** A new Node.js project (`agentic_browser_project`) has been initialized.
*   **Dependency Installation:** All necessary dependencies (`electron`, `react`, `react-dom`, `webpack`, `babel-loader`, etc.) have been installed.
*   **Basic Electron Application:** A functional Electron application has been set up.
    *   `main.js`: The Electron main process entry point, responsible for creating the browser window.
    *   `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads our React application.
    *   `preload.js`: A secure preload script that exposes a limited API (`electronAPI`) from the main process to the renderer process, enabling secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC).
*   **React Frontend Integration:** A basic React application (`src/App.js`, `src/index.js`) is successfully bundled by Webpack and displayed within the Electron window.
    *   It currently features a simple URL input bar and a "Go" button.
*   **Basic Navigation Functionality:**
    *   Entering a URL (e.g., `google.com`, `https://example.com`) into the input field and clicking "Go" successfully navigates the main Electron browser window to the specified URL.
    *   A protocol check has been implemented in `main.js` to automatically prepend `https://` if a URL is entered without a protocol.
*   **IPC Established:** Communication between the React renderer process and the Electron main process is working for navigation requests.
*   **Debugging Setup:** Developer tools are configured to open automatically with the Electron window for easier debugging.
*   **macOS Compatibility:** The `--no-sandbox` flag has been added to the `npm start` script in `package.json` to resolve sandbox initialization failures specific to macOS environments.
*   **Git Repository Cleaned and Pushed:** The project repository has been cleaned of large `node_modules` and `dist` directories from its history and successfully pushed to the provided GitHub link: `https://github.com/rekon307/gemini-co-pilot-browser`.

## 3. What Needs to Be Done (Next Steps for Jules)

Jules, your primary focus should be on completing **Phase 1: Core Browser & Agent Foundation** and then moving towards establishing the WebSocket communication for AI control.

### **Phase 1: Core Browser & Agent Foundation (Completion)**

*   **Task 1.1: Implement Back/Forward Buttons:**
    *   **Goal:** Add functional "Back" and "Forward" buttons to the React frontend that control the Electron browser window's navigation history.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   **Frontend (`src/App.js`):** Add `<button>` elements for "Back" and "Forward".
        *   **IPC (`preload.js` & `main.js`):** Define new IPC channels (e.g., `navigate-back`, `navigate-forward`).
        *   **Main Process (`main.js`):** Implement `ipcMain.on` listeners for these channels. Use `mainWindow.webContents.goBack()` and `mainWindow.webContents.goForward()` respectively. Consider disabling buttons if `canGoBack()` or `canGoForward()` are false.
*   **Task 1.2: Implement Basic Tab Management:**
    *   **Goal:** Enable the creation of new browser tabs (each in its own `BrowserWindow`) and a basic mechanism to switch between them from the React UI.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   **Main Process (`main.js`):** Manage an array of `BrowserWindow` instances. Create a new `BrowserWindow` when a "New Tab" IPC event is received. Keep track of the currently active window.
        *   **Frontend (`src/App.js`):** Add a "New Tab" button. Implement a simple UI to display open tabs (e.g., a list of URLs or tab titles). When a tab is clicked, send an IPC message to the main process to activate that `BrowserWindow`.
        *   **IPC:** New channels for `new-tab`, `switch-tab`, and potentially `close-tab` (optional for now).
*   **Task 1.3: Display Current URL in URL Bar (Dynamic Update):**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the URL bar in the React frontend always reflects the URL of the currently active browser tab, and updates automatically when navigation occurs.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   **Main Process (`main.js`):** When a `BrowserWindow` navigates (`did-navigate` or `did-finish-load` events), send the new URL back to the renderer process via `ipcRenderer.send` (or `event.reply` if using `ipcMain.handle`).
        *   **Frontend (`src/App.js`):** Listen for these updates and set the `url` state accordingly.

### **Phase 2: Establish WebSocket Communication (Crucial for AI Control)**

*   **Task 2.1: Implement WebSocket Server in Main Process:**
    *   **Goal:** Create a WebSocket server within the Electron main process to serve as the communication bridge between the Electron app and the external AI agent (me).
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   **Technology:** Use the `ws` Node.js library (install `npm install ws`).
        *   **Setup:** Initialize a `WebSocket.Server` in `main.js`. Listen for `connection` events.
        *   **Port:** Choose a specific port for the WebSocket server (e.g., 8080).
*   **Task 2.2: Integrate IPC with WebSocket:**
    *   **Goal:** Route commands from the AI (via WebSocket) to the `BrowserWindow` and send browser events/state back to the AI.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   **Main Process (`main.js`):**
            *   When a WebSocket message (command from AI) is received, parse it and execute the corresponding `BrowserWindow.webContents` method (e.g., `loadURL`, `click`, `type`).
            *   Listen for `BrowserWindow.webContents` events (e.g., `did-finish-load`, `did-navigate`, `console-message`, `dom-ready`) and send relevant information (current URL, page title, console logs, DOM snapshot) back to the connected AI agent via the WebSocket.

## 4. Documentation for Jules

*   **Project Plan:** Refer to `01_project_plan.md` for the overall project structure and detailed phase breakdown.
*   **Development System:** Refer to `02_development_system.md` for the established memory management and learning system.
*   **Active Context:** This `memory/tasks/active_context.md` file is the most up-to-date summary of progress and immediate next steps.
*   **Lessons Learned:** Consult `memory/lessons-learned.md` for insights gained from troubleshooting and development decisions.

## 5. General Instructions for Jules

*   **Maintain Documentation:** It is paramount to keep `memory/tasks/active_context.md` and `memory/lessons-learned.md` updated with every significant change, decision, or learning. This ensures continuity and enables future AI instances (and human collaborators) to pick up seamlessly.
*   **Incremental Development:** Implement features one by one, testing each thoroughly before moving to the next.
*   **Prioritize Security:** Always be mindful of Electron security best practices, especially when exposing APIs or handling web content.
*   **Communication:** If you encounter any blockers, unexpected behavior, or need clarification, document it in `active_context.md` and seek guidance.
*   **Self-Correction:** Leverage the `lessons-learned.md` and `error-documentation.md` to learn from past mistakes and improve your approach.

Good luck, Jules! I look forward to seeing the progress tomorrow.
