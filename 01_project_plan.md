## Phase 1: Core Browser & Agent Foundation (Alpha)

### 1.1 Project Initialization and Setup

*   Initialized a new Node.js project using `npm init -y`.
*   Installed core dependencies: `electron`, `playwright`, `react`, `react-dom`, and build tools (`@babel/core`, `@babel/preset-env`, `@babel/preset-react`, `babel-loader`, `webpack`, `webpack-cli`).
*   Created `main.js` as the Electron entry point.
*   Created `index.html` as the main HTML file for the browser window.
*   Created `src` directory with `App.js` (main React component) and `index.js` (React renderer).
*   Configured `webpack.config.js` to bundle the React application.
*   Added `start` and `build` scripts to `package.json`.
*   Successfully built the React application using `npm run build`.
*   Successfully started the Electron application in the background using `npm start &`.

**Current Status:** The basic Electron application is running, and the React app is successfully displayed in the window. Resolved startup issues by creating `preload.js`, correcting `main` entry in `package.json`, and adding `--no-sandbox` flag to `npm start` script.

### 1.2 Core Functionality: Browser Control and IPC

*   **Browser Control:** Instead of Playwright, we are using Electron's native `webContents` API for direct manipulation of the browser engine embedded in Electron.
*   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** The React frontend sends commands to the Electron main process via `ipcRenderer.send()`, and the main process uses `ipcMain.on()` to receive these commands and execute them using `webContents`.
*   **`preload.js` for secure API exposure:** The `preload.js` script exposes a secure, limited API (`electronAPI`) to the renderer process, preventing direct Node.js access from the frontend for security.

**Current Status:**
*   Successfully implemented a basic URL bar and "Go" button in the React frontend.
*   Established IPC communication to send URLs from the renderer to the main process.
*   The main process successfully receives the URL and navigates the `BrowserWindow` using `mainWindow.loadURL()`.
*   Added a protocol check in `main.js` to prepend `https://` if missing from the entered URL, ensuring successful navigation.

**Remaining Tasks for Phase 1:**
*   **Basic Browser Features:** Implement back/forward buttons, and a mechanism for tab management.
*   **The "Co-Pilot" Panel:** Design and implement a dedicated panel in the UI for communication between the user and the AI agent.
*   **Live View:** Ensure the main browser window is the primary display for web content, and explore ways to integrate its view more seamlessly with the React UI if needed.
*   **Manual Override:** Implement functionality for the user to directly interact with the browser (click, type) and for the AI to observe these actions.
*   **Establish WebSocket Communication:** Set up a WebSocket server in the main process to allow the Gemini agent to send and receive commands and data to/from the Electron application.
